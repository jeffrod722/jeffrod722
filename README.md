I am currently a college student in the Information Systems and Technology program. I aim to acquire my associates and hopefully transfer to Rutgers in the future to go for my bachelors.



- 🌙 I am working **overnights** as a supervisor at my job and balancing school with that is seriously difficult.
- 💻 My mission is to learn as much as I can about the world of computers. Whether it is coding, hardware, software, troubleshooting, I aim to Learn it _ALL_!

  At the moment, my current hobbies include
  - reading 📖
  - videogames 🎮
  - spending time outside 🌞
  
🏎️ I have developed a little bit of an obsessions with Formula 1 and I am very excited to watch the 2025 season, it will be a **__GREAT__** one for sure
